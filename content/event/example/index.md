  Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental

  disorder recognized by the World Health Organization as a growing global public health

  concern. Early interventions such as the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) can improve

  intellectual ability, adaptive behaviors and decrease symptom severity in ASD children.

  In low-resource settings such as South Africa, the lack of autism specialists necessitates

  early intervention models that can be delivered in-home by caregivers. However,

  important questions remain as to whether caregivers, coached by non-specialists, can

  deliver early autism interventions effectively.


  Study Aims: The long-term goal of the main ESDM study in South Africa is to

  advance understanding of the efficacy of caregiver-delivered early autism interventions,

  coached by non-specialists, in lower-resourced settings. 


  This pre-pilot study aims to: 

  1) Document adaptations made to a caregiver coaching approach, informed by ESDM principles and delivered by non-specialist providers in South Africa; 


  2) Examine non-specialist coaching fidelity; and 


  3) Examine the fidelity of caregiver implementation of ESDM across 12 weeks of intervention sessions.


  Methods: Modifications were made to the original ESDM program to improve

  intervention fit to local settings before the study happened; these adaptations were

  documented using the Wiltsey-Stirman framework. Two local Early Childhood

  Development (ECD) workers (non-specialists) and two caregiver-child dyads were

  recruited to participate in the study in Cape Town, South Africa. There were twelve one-

  hour sessions of ECD workers coaching caregivers to deliver the intervention with their


  children across twelve weeks. Each session was video recorded and then coded

  following the Caregiver Fidelity Scale and the Coaching Fidelity Scale. In this study, an 80% cutoff line was used to define acceptable fidelity for individual items overall mean

  scores on the caregiver and coaching fidelity scales.

  Results: Both caregivers and ECD Workers met some challenges in certain rating

  items during intervention sessions. Caregiver 1 met the fidelity threshold for the overall

  scale in one out of twelve intervention sessions, and caregiver 2 met the threshold in five

  out of twelve intervention sessions. There was no visible change in the trend of caregiver

  and coach performances across 12 weeks. ECD Worker 1 met the fidelity threshold for

  the overall scale in six out of twelve intervention sessions and ECD worker 2 met the

  threshold in eleven out of twelve sessions.


  Conclusion: Using non-specialists to coach caregivers on ASD treatment shows

  promise as an approach help to reduce the resource gap by providing accessible and

  affordable early ASD intervention in lower-resource settings. However, additional

  culturally-sensitive adaptations are needed to make the treatment reach its full potential in

  a multi-cultural community like South Africa. Given the challenges we observed with

  intervention fidelity in this setting, training and supervision must continue to be tailored

  with the intervention to ensure that high quality services are delivered sustainably. If

  successful, the intervention model has the potential to be scaled up in community settings

  globally in order to address the needs of young children and families impacted by ASD.
