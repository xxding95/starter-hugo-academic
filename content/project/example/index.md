Emerging evidence suggests that young people are experiencing more mental health distress than
ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, TikTokâ€™s daily usage has surged throughout the pandemic
period, with the average Canadian user spending 17 hours/month on the social media app. Eighty percent of

Canadian TikTok users are 12-30 years of age. Youth are using TikTok to communicate with peers and receive up-
to-date information on mental health. For example, in the last year alone, #mentalhealth and derivations of this
term have been accessed tens of billions of times on TikTok. There has been a complete absence of research
exploring the quality and sentiment of mental health information on TikTok, patterns of how youth use the
platform to learn about mental health, and how public health can leverage TikTok to connect youth to services. The
objectives of this project are to understand the impact TikTok is having on the mental health of young people
during the COVID-19 pandemic by:

(1) Assessing the quality, identifying patterns, and analyzing sentiments of mental health information and advice
conveyed on the TikTok social media platform throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; &
(2) Elevating the voices of diverse young people to understand how Canadian youth use TikTok during the
pandemic to learn about mental health and connect to services.
